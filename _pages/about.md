I am a Ph.D student in [Beihang University, The School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://scse.buaa.edu.cn/English/Home.htm). I am advised by [Professor Wenfei Fan](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wenfei/). Before that, I obtained my bachelor degree from [Northwest A&F University, College of Information Engeering](https://cie.nwafu.edu.cn/).

I have broad interest in Recommendation Systems and Graph Modeling. Currently, I am working on mining special patterns from graph data.
