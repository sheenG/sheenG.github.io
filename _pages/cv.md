### Graph Data Mining and Recommendation System Optimization
**Project Overview**: RecLogic, a logic framework to enhance the accuracy of machine learning (ML) models for recommendation systems by integrating logic conditions to reduce false positives and false negatives without retraining models.

**Technical Approach**: (1) Developed prediction rules (TIEs) that integrate dual-star graph patterns with logic conditions, reducing false positives/negatives by 16.21% AUC in critical prediction zones (i.e., near the recommendation threshold). (2) Implemented a generation-based approach using LSTM for pattern generation and decision trees for predicate generation to learn TIEs. (3) Proposed a parallel algorithm for applying TIEs in the recommendation module, achieving scalable performance by parallelizing path matching.

**Tech Stack**: Python/PyTorch (traditional recommendation models), C++ (subgraph matching), LSTM, Decision Trees.

**Deployment**: SIGMOD 2023. Implemented in AIRec Recommendation platform. https://airec.grandhoo.com/

### Graph Neural Networks and Explainable Recommendation Systems
**Project Overview**:Makex, a logic approach to explaining why a GNN-based model M (ùë•, ùë¶) recommends item ùë¶ to user ùë•Ôºåproviding both global and local explanations for recommendations.

**Technical Approach**: (1) Proposed Rules for ExPlanations (REPs) defined by dual-star graph patterns and dependency, revealing the topological and feature conditions for recommendations. (2) Implemented a GNN-guided algorithm using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to discover REPs and generate global explanations. (3) Utilized the 1-WL test to explain GNN behaviors, ensuring faithfulness to GNN predictions, achieving 32% higher recognizability and 42% higher reliability in global explanations compared to baselines. (4) Developed a Top-k algorithm for local explanations, the fidelity and sparsity of its top-1 explanation are 0.893 and 0.00225% on average, 80.62% and 3 orders of magnitude better than the baselines, respectively. It takes only 0.38s to generate top-1 explanation on large graphs, 75.8X faster than baselines on average.

**Tech Stack**: Python/PyTorch (GNNs), C++ (subgraph matching), MCTS, 1-WL test

**Deployment**: VLDB 2024. Implemented in MedHunter AI Drug Discovery Platform. https://medhunter.grandhoo.com/

### Graph Data Mining and Logic-Driven Sequential Recommendation
**Project Overview**: LDSRec, a novel framework that integrates logic rules with sequential recommendation models by representation learning to capture users' short-term behaviors and long-term preferences.

**Technical Approach**: (1) Defined SEquential Rules (SERs) that combine sequential graph patterns with logic preconditions, enabling polynomial-time representation learning. (2) Transformed user behavior sequences into a global heterogeneous graph, maintaining strict temporal order via path-centric subsequence division, and item co-occurrence dependencies, and capturing high-order dependencies through correlated interaction paths. (3) Combined SER-guided embeddings with original model outputs, optimized via contrastive learning to align logic rules with latent user interest representations. The model was further optimized using a loss function that integrates logic-driven contributions.

**Tech Stack**: Python/PyTorch (sequential recommendation), C++ (subgraph matching), LSTM/Transformer, contrastive learning

**Deployment**: Under submission VLDB 2025.
